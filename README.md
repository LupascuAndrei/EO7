# EO7

Code used in the 2016 edition of EESTEC Olympics Hackathon.

Tracks user motion using a webcam to play games ( client.py + server.py ) or even to input words ( keyboard.py )

Use a blue object to control a cursor, and a red one as a left click ( upper half means clicked, lower click-released)

Server.py requires python 3 and opengl lib installed.
Client.py and keyboard.py require OpenCV installed and built
